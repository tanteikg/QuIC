# QuIC
Quantum Interpreted Circuits
QuIC (pronounced “ is a Quantum interpreter and simulator whose design was inspired by Terry Rudolph’s “Q is for Quantum”. The objective for developing
QuIC is to promote the understanding of basic Quantum circuits through a hands on, responsive approach QuIC is targeted at Computer Science users wanting to
realize Quantum algorithms quickly and conveniently, without needing to consider the underlying physical structure of the Quantum computer.

QuIC is written in C POSIX and currently runs as a command line tool that takes in a sequence of text strings to represent the ordering of gates that operate
on the qubits sequentially.
